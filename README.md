üîç Key features include:

1. Sales by Region, Segment, and Product Category: Identifying top-performing areas and opportunities for growth.

2. Sales and Profit Trends over Time: Analyzing seasonal patterns and identifying areas for improvement.

3. Customer Segmentation: Understanding customer preferences and tailoring marketing strategies accordingly.

4. Sales Forecasting: Provides a detailed sales forecast for the next 15 days. This is valuable for businesses as it allows them to plan their inventory and staffing levels accordingly.

This dashboard empowers decision-makers to make data-driven decisions and optimize sales strategies. I'm eager to contribute to the superstore's continued success by utilizing advanced analytics and forecasting techniques.
